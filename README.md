## Linting

This project uses [Vale](https://vale.sh/docs/) for automated linting and compliance with the Posit style guide. Vale runs [via GH action on PRs](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron-docs/actions/workflows/lint.yml), but you can also run it locally before you submit a PR. 

- [Install Vale](https://vale.sh/docs/vale-cli/installation/) locally.
- Use `quarto render` to generate the HTML that can be linted.
- Use `vale _site/` to lint the HTML generated by Quarto.
