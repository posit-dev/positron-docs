## Reporting issues

We currently use the issue tracker for [Positron](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron). Please report documentation bugs and feature requests at <https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues>.

## Linting

This project uses [Vale](https://vale.sh/docs/) for automated linting and compliance with the Posit style guide. 

- If you are a Posit employee, you can find the "Posit Documentation Style Guide" on Confluence.
- If you are an external contributor, we as reviewers will take responsibility for compliance with the guidelines. Thank you for being willing to improve our docs!

Vale runs [via GH action on PRs](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron-docs/actions/workflows/lint.yml), but you can also run it locally before you submit a PR if you have [installed Vale](https://vale.sh/docs/vale-cli/installation/) locally.

- First, use `quarto render` to generate the HTML that can be linted.
- Then, run `vale _site/` to lint the HTML generated by Quarto.
