## Giving feedback

Most feedback should start in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/discussions). This is a great place to share ideas, ask questions, and get feedback from the team.

We're particularly interested in feedback on the following:

- Questions about functionality
- Reports for issues, warts, and roadblocks
- Things you find interesting, pleasant, or irritating
- Troubleshooting
- Ideas for features
- What's missing
- What works for you
- What doesn't

## Reporting issues

If you find a bug, please [open an issue](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/new/choose).

### Before filing an issue

- If you're not sure if it's a bug or not, ask via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/discussions).
- Search the issue tracker for related issues; your issue may already have been reported. If it has, don't move on; add a note describing your experience to the existing issue.
- We lock older issues. If you believe you have found a problem related to a locked issue, please open a new issue, linking to the original one.
- Try to prepare a mininally reproducible test case.

### Filing an issue

When filing an issue, please include the following:

- The exact version of Positron you're using (from *Positron > About Positron* or *Help > About*).
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- What you saw happen, and what you *expected* to see happen.
- Any relevant error logs from the Developer Tools console. 

### After filing an issue

We're a small team, so it may take some time for us to follow up! Watch your issue for questions or clarifications from the team. 

If your issue is fixed by the Positron team, don't close it yourself; someone from the team will close the issue once we've verified the fix internally.
